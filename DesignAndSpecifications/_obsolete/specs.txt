Chrumck's Awesome Soldata Killer:

misc
-------------

 - come up with some catchy name




 user requirements
 --------------------

 - needs to be super easy to set up. If possible, just switch on the Instrument and bam, it's on the map with all readings and in proper spot


 funtionalities of the interface
 -------------------------------
 - map has to be fluent, work like Zillow (it means filtering the number of points. How do I decide which points stay?)
 - automatically show instruments on the map with the current position and current reading (the default one).
 - Clicking on the instrument automatically brings up the time graph.
 - can be moved to a different position (maybe indicated with a different icon style)
 - 

 - right clicking instrument (or maybe double clicking? Think exactly what will be the most intuitive) brings up more options:
    - change the default from time graph to other options (think about other options)

 - all settings have to be saved per user (last view settings, point settings) and be able to be exported to be used by another user in a format which will be easy to edit manually (probably JSON)

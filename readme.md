##MoniScope

###So this is the beginning...

**MoniScope** is going to be a web application which will work pretty much like Google Maps... except for measurements. The aim is to build a crisp, user-friendly interface which is going to show measurements from variety of wireless remote sensors, be it simple temperature gauge in your basement, a voltage and speed meter in your car, or a complex network of instruments on a construction site to measure the influence of site activities on the surroundings. 

The idea is to make it hassle free as much as possible. You should just set up your instrument to connect to internet, give it credentials to talk to MoniScope, and the rest is done for you automatically.

So, this is the thought. Let's see where it leads me!

Oh, by the way, this is going to be an open source project. You want to run your own instance of the service? Knock yourserlf out!
